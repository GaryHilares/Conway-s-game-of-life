# Conway's Game of Life simulator

## What is this project about?

After reading a book about John Von Neumann, I got interested in cellular automata, especially in
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Despite having very simple rules, there
are many finite patterns with interesting behavior, such as spaceships, glider guns, and "The Eater".

As a result of this interest, I decided to implement a simulator of this game. I thought that doing this would be a
great way of challenging myself and consolidating my programming skills. In the future, I am considering to also
implement some games built on top of the Game of Life, but for now it is not a concrete part of my plan.

I expect this program to be used by students interested in cellular automata, like me, or other people who just want to
have fun experimenting with it. By interacting with this program, users might increase their interest in mathematics,
computer science, or other formal sciences.
